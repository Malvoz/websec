		<h2><span class="secno">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		The open web platform is running on diverse devices, such as tablet, PC, smart phone, and cars systems. Driven by an expectation from users and service providers, a majority of those devices are embedding some technology allowing to offer some secure services. One can think about secure chips such as embedded secure element, TPM, UICC, or proximity smart card, using BLE or NFC communication means. Another technology getting traction is the Trusted Execution environment. Both type of technology are offering some advantages in terms of secure execution and storage. Secure element and TEE can offer some services, which are names secure services, as their merits in term of integrity and confidentiality are improved. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This document is proposing some use cases where the web apps could benefit from those secure services. In addition, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of such secure services, the hardware based secure services community group has chosen two services, for which some API will be suggested and some protoypes will be developed. Those services are the secure transaction confirmation and the secure credential storage. 
		</p>

		<h3><span class="secno">1.1 </span>Terminology</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Secure Service: any service that should manage sensitive operations and that would benefit of/depends upon the 
			use of an hardware based security solution.</li>
			<li>Relying party: the Web application providing the Secure Service and requesting the hardware access</li>
			<li>Issuing authority: well known in X509 certificates scheme as certificate authority, the issuing authority is in charge of issuing a associated key/identity pair to a known identity and to maintain its lifecycle. The end-user identification is out-of-scope of this document but is clearly mandatory to associate a key to a genuine identity.</li>
			<li>Origin: in reference to the Single Origin Policy, an origin is referred in this document to an HTTP URL with scheme, host, port without path</li>
			<li>Secure Element: A secure element is a tamper proof device, providing a secure storage and execution environment for sensitive data and processing. It offers both physical and logical protection against attacks, ensuring integrity and confidentiality of its content.</li>
			<li>User Verification Method: This is the way the Secure Element authorize keys usage only to the genuine user. Could be what you know like a PIN code or what you are through a biometric face/finger/iris... end-user authentication</li>
			<li>Identity: to be verified by the issuing authority, the identity is cryptographically linked to the key demonstrating who has confirmed a transaction or signed a document</li>
			<li>Key: asymmetric cryptographic public/private key pair, sometimes linked to an identity</li>
			<li>Trusted User Interface: User interface component outside the direct browser scope providing 
			an additional level of trust in regards to the context presented to the end-user to acquire its acknowledgment</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><span class="secno">2. </span>Problem Statement</h2>

		<p>At this time Secure Element are not yet usable by web applications. For years, various form factors have been usable thanks to many native API and technologies (PKCS#11, Microsoft API like CSP / Minidriver, Java applet ...). Use cases are valid for native applications and web app, but browsers have not been working on integrating those technologies. still here but not the browser access, The need to use secure services in all types of application (native, web app, hybrid) is becoming important, especially on the mobile devices. This document is targeting to define the next generation Javascript API for hardware based keys management and usage, including two specific features :the secure transaction confirmation and the secure credential storage. Those two technologies were identified, because they are key to the corresponding underlying components requirements to re-enable a strong security and identity ecosystem.</p>
		
		<p>The management of keys is associated with the problem of key usage. On the open web platform, the security principle that prevails everywhere is the Single Origin Policy. This strict policy may have some limitation in some specific cases, where several parties are involved in the delivery of a secure service.</p>
		
		<p>Single Origin Policy: one main matter of interest of this reportthe hardware-based secure services community group members is how to protect key usage considering the special use case where the credentials are used outside their issuing origin. As an example: Let's consider that a domain foo.com issues a key. Because the keys won't be accessible with a Javascript API from any domain, we have to design a secure system where the domain bar.com is allowed to use this key.</p>

		
		<p>This first version of the report will not address this issue but will focus on:
		<ul>
			<li>pre-existing X509 certificates accessible under the full control of the end-user to any transaction confirmation request.</li>
			<li>any API issued key MUST only be managed and used by its origin</li>
		</ul>
		Further extension will be added to authorize various origins to use and manage a particular key.</p>
		
		<p><em>Position to FIDO and WebAuth standards:</em> this document is focusing on providing web developers means to
		issue and use identity keys (whether they are X509 certificates or any other cryptographic model with underlying
		asymmetric cryptography).
		FIDO standards is related to device authentication: in the FIDO vision, it is up to the relying party 
		to manage the link between the credential and the identity.</p>
		
		<p><em>Position to WebCryptoAPI standards:</em> this report includes to WebCryptoAPI so that
		web developers can rely upon the same API but with a different initialization (like Java Cryptographic Engine with hardware provider).</p>
		
		<p>The user verification method is out of scope of this specification. But it should be clear whether a key is protected by
		<ul>
			<li>the user presence confirmation (presence)</li>
			<li>the underlying OS user verification method like an handle to the registered fingerprint template (os)</li>
			<li>a specific and private key binded user verification method like a specific PIN or a specific fingerprint/iris template (active)</p></li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		The Relying Party should take care that:
		<ul>
			<li>with the passive option, there won't be any effective user confirmation - it's only about device authentication</li>
			<li>with the presence option there is no assurance that the right user is really behind the user-agent</li>
			<li>with the os option, there is options provided by the OS manufacturer to manage real world use cases - i.e. sensor not capturing the fingerprint switching to the PIN code</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h2><span class="secno">3. </span>Use cases</h2>
		<p>
			QUESTION: Need to provide here names of well-known customers to help pushing the standards to browser makers?
		</p>
		<p>
			Several services, requiring some security guarantees, thus being deployed on hardware based technology, are already existing in native environments. 
		</p>
		
		<h3><span class="secno">3.1 </span>Governments with eID for digital public services access and usage</h3>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://e-estonia.com/">eEstonia</a></li>
			<li>Belgium eID with <a href="http://eid.belgium.be/en/available_eid_applications/online_government_applications/toepassingen_voor_burgers">eService ecosystem</a></li>

		<h3><span class="secno">3.2 </span>Banks with smartcards for corporate operations signature</h3>
		<p>To request to a bank</p>
		<h3><span class="secno">3.3 </span>Transparent device authentication for online payment confirmation on 3DSecure scheme</h3>
		<p>To be completed by Brian (Visa Europe)</p>

		<h3><span class="secno">3.5 </span>The expectation from secure services</h3>
		<p>
		Whatever is the envisaged use case, signing a tax payment, confirming a transaction payment, validating the signature of a document, the service needs to rely on a genuine signature and user control. The two features that hardware-based secure services community group members elected to test are related to those strong expectations. 
		</p>
		
		<h2><span class="secno">4. </span>Secure transaction and secure credential API</h2>

		<p>This section contains the API description and the different rationale for the architecture and design choices.</p>
		<p>Note : all use cases are envisaged with a pre-existing key set. 	</p>
		<h3><span class="secno">4.1 </span>Usage</h3>
			
		<p>This subpart of the API is relying upon pre-existing keys.</p>

		<h4><span class="secno">4.1.1 </span>Overview of the secure transaction confirmation </h4>

		<p>Goal: to give some assurance to a remote entity that a transaction is confirmed. Confirm that what was sent was 
		communicated to the user, and what was displayed to the user is what was confirmed (What You See Is What You Confirm)<p>
		<p>This first section covers the various usages of keys. These use cases are not highly sensitive in terms 
		of transaction context confidentiality, which means that standard SOP rules are considered sufficient without any need
		for end-to-end encryption (like secure messaging). <br/>
		To avoid context swapping, it is mandatory that the non-repudiation message contains specific data for the requested
		transaction with the requesting party, the purpose of the transaction and the date of the operation.</p>

		<div class="blockContent"><pre class="code"><code class="idl-code">
[NoInterfaceObject]
enum UVMMode { "passive", "presence", "os", "active" };

[Exposed=(Window)]
interface HBSS {
	Promise<any> confirm(DOMString origin, DOMString NRMessage, UVMMode mode, ArrayBuffer[] issuingAuthorities);
	Promise<any> deviceAuthentication(DOMString origin, BufferSource challenge, ArrayBuffer[] issuingAuthorities);
	Promise<any> sign(DOMString origin, DOMString NRMessage, BufferSource data, UVMMode mode, ArrayBuffer[] issuingAuthorities);
}
</code></pre></div>
		
		<h4>
			<span class="secno">4.1.2 </span>Transaction confirmation</h4>

		<p>This operation is defined to request from the browser and underlying security capabilities to ensure that the context 
		has been presented to the end-user and provide non-repudiation</p>

		<h4>
			<span class="secno">4.1.3 </span>Device authentication</h4>

		<p>This operation should be used when the relying party is trying to use a hardware key to authenticate the device without
		any user consent</p>

		<h4>
			<span class="secno">4.1.4 </span>Digital signature</h4>

		<p>This operation is defined to allow binary data signature.</p>
		<p>Assumption: for many different reasons, complex data are not the right
		format to get the end-user consent and confirm her/his acknowledgment: 
		<ul>
			<li>Liability: The major reasons is that this type of API is targeting valuable transactions with liability. 
			And for most regulations, liability relies upon the end-user capability to understand the message and confirm it.
			So only the simplest format should be considered: no color, no emphasis, no image.
			</li>
			<li>Technical: structured documents (XHTML, XML, RDF, PDF ...) cannot be presented in trusted UI</li>
			<li>Accessibility: no image should be used</li>
		</ul>
		So it should be:
		<ul>
			<li>text only</li>
			<li>not too short: it should give enough context information to protect against social engineering and replay attacks</li>
			<li>not too long: it should be displayable on almost every end-user terminal and read by the end-user</li>
			<li>scoped: it should target a particular operation (type, amount, beneficiary ...) at a particular time</li>
			<li>localized (UTF-8)</li>
		</ul>
		What is should not be:
		<ul>
			<li>full list of terms and conditions - but it can be the operation to confirm that the end-user agree with a particular version of the terms and conditions</li>
			<li>a generic operation request because it would not be scoped</li>
		</ul>
		
		NOTE: a particular attention should be paid to UTF-8 characters support with the wide variety of similar characters.
		Therefore, both	the context and the data should be signed at the same time with the same key. It is then up to the relying 
		party to ensure	that the data associated with the context are both signed and they match the initial request
		The user has accepted the context (and liability may rely only on that context in regards to this cryptographic operation) 
		But thanks to that he/she has produced with its own cryptographic key the binary data signature. 
		The data signature (i.e. PDF signature) is then a way to embed into the data the user consent.</p>
		<p>SECURITY NOTE: it could occur that the binary data are altered before signature by a malware or javascript 
		or even the browser. So the altered binary data would be successfully signed on the user agent side. But in this
		case this is the relying party responsibility to check that the data and the context received are signed 
		with the same key and at the same time. It MUST reject any attempt to submit binary signed data if they are not provided with 
		a valid signed context.
		</p>
		<p>Within this operation, the mode for the user verification method MUST NOT be "presence".</p>

			<span class="secno">4.2 </span>Secure Credential Storage</h3>

		<h4>
			<span class="secno">4.1.1 </span>General consideration</h4>

		<p>
		... Relation to Web Crypto API: same API but with a different initialization engine...

		<h2><span class="secno">5. </span>Architectures and security requirements</h2>
		
		<p>These samples are provided to split the responsibilities of each vendor / software providers.

		<h3><span class="secno">5.1 </span>PC-like environments</h3>

		<p>It is typically the environment where secure elements - either smartcards with readers or usb tokens - are used 
		with middleware through PKCS#11 or Microsoft Minidriver. In this architecture, the trusted UI is:
		<ul>
			<li>Either the middleware for PKCS#11</li>
			<li>Microsoft operating system which manage the secure element user interface</li>
		</ul>
		
		In terms of user experience, browser implementers will be invited to support a mechanism of white and black lists of 
		authorized domains related to each key, so that an end-user could reject any request outside a specific origin for a particular key
		
		NOTE: it would require a Mini driver interface update to allow the Non Repudiation message to be provided to the API,
		instead of a basic data to sign.
		</p>
		

		<h3><span class="secno">5.2 </span>Mobile environments</h3>

		<p>In mobile environments, Secure Elements are either:
		<ul>
			<li>device binded like embedded Secure Element</li>
			<li>roaming like SIM or external NFC/BLE factors</li>
		</ul>
		But there is no capability to add middleware. It is up the OS manufacturer to provide support for the
		Secure Elements and provide an API for third party applications including browsers. 
		</p>
		
		<h4><span class="secno">5.2.1 </span>Generic mobile environments</h4>
		<p>
		In this situation, the trusted user interface should be part of the Operating System, interacting with
		the Secure Credential Storage
		</p>

		<h4><span class="secno">5.2.2 </span>Mobile environments with Trusted Execution Environment</h4>
		<p>
		In this situation, the browser is a trusted app and the trusted UI is relying upon the existing
		TEE functions (See [GP_TEE])
		</p>
		
		<h3><span class="secno">5.3 </span>About implementations considerations</h3>
		
		<p>Implementation into a mobile phone will require:
		<ul>
			<li>browser modifications to interact with TEE</li>
			<li>a trusted application interacting with the Secure Element</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
